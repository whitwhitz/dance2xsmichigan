    <h1>About 2XS</h1>

    <div class="description">
      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>Dance 2XS Michigan is an student-led urban dance group at the University of Michigan. It is one of four collegiate chapters of the international dance company, 2XS International, with sister chapters at other universities including UIUC and Purdue. The first chapter was founded on the UIUC campus in 1998 by Patrick Chen and Lee Daniel. Since then, the Dance 2XS legacy has expanded, creating a world wide family of passionate and talented dancers. Our family continues to push the boundaries of artistic expression and dance as it grows within the hip hop industry.  </p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>Each semester we host an urban dance showcase called Barnite where we invite other performance groups to come dance with us at Necto Nightclub, in downtown Ann Arbor. Over 500 people come to watch performances ranging from fellow university hip hop teams to professional recording artists. It's definitely one of the biggest nights in college dance as we have completely sold out the past 3 shows.</p>

      <h2>The Team</h2>
      <p>Our group is completely student run. Each year, we elect a core group of members that are responsible for keeping 2XS running smoothly including: 1 executive director, 2 artistic directors, 2 public relations chairs, 1 treasurer, and 1 social chair. While the artistic directors manage overall artistic visions for the group, all members of the team have opportunities to choreograph performance pieces and teach masterclasses. See some of our student work on the performances tab!   </p>
